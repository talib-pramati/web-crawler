Web crawler

Write a simple crawler to crawl and download all mails for year 2014 from http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-users/. The project must have a build system and the build system should create a jar with a defined application entry point (java -jar crawler.jar [opts] should work, assuming crawler.jar was the jar created by the build system)

Iterations

    Time: 1 week Deliverable: working crawler which can download all mails
    Time: 1 week Deliverable: Robust crawler which can survive internet connection loss and can resume from last run
    Time: 1 week Deliverable: Performance and memory optimization for the crawler

Goals

    Write good code which follows best practices (naming conventions, formatting, optimal use)
    Write unit tests for relevant sections
    Write production quality code (options to set the log level at runtime, decent logging which can be used to troubleshoot)
